Introduction
The Super nRF52840 features the powerful Nordic nRF52840 MCU, integrated with Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity, and comes in a compact and sleek form factor, making it ideal for wearable devices and IoT projects. The single-sided PCB design and onboard Bluetooth antenna greatly facilitate the rapid deployment of IoT projects.

Super52840 integrates a charging indicator LED and a tri-color LED. It offers 11 digital I/O pins that can be used as PWM pins, and 6 analog I/O pins that can serve as ADC inputs. It supports three common serial interfaces: UART, I2C, and SPI. The board also includes 2MB onboard memory, and can be programmed using Arduino, MicroPython, CircuitPython, or other programming languages.

Super52840 is a replacement for the Xiao nRF52840, and they share the same pinout. Super52840 uses the Xiao bootloader, and compared to the Xiao nRF52840, it provides 7 additional I/O pins located on the back of the board (P0.31, P0.15, P0.19, P1.01, P1.03, P1.07, P1.05).
